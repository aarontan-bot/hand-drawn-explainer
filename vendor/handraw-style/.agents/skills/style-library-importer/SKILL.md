# Text-Defined Style Library Importer

Use this Skill when the user wants to add a visual style to the local hand-drawn style library with a style name, visual traits, or both. It is separate from `tweet-style-importer`: an image-only request belongs to the Tweet workflow and must not receive a new number here.

## Interpret the input

- **Name only:** keep the supplied name as the style label, do not invent or store visual traits, and register `name_activation=strong`, `traits_activation=none` for `gpt-image-2`.
- **Name plus traits:** preserve the name, retain only positive concrete visual traits, remove negative clauses such as `避免`、`不要`、`不准`、`禁止` or `无写实纹理`, and register `name_activation=weak`, `traits_activation=strong`.
- **Traits only:** invent a readable Chinese style label and a concise English generation name, retain only positive concrete visual traits, and register `name_activation=weak`, `traits_activation=strong`.
- **Image only:** do not change the library. Explain that image-only imports are handled by `tweet-style-importer`.

For every text-defined style, `gpt-image-2` must use its configured text activation and must not receive a reference image. Unknown models retain the library's existing image fallback behavior.

## Representative image

If the user provides an image alongside textual input, use it directly as the representative source image; do not generate another one.

If no image is provided, generate exactly one original 1:1 representative image with `gpt-image-2`. Select a simple neutral subject and setting that make the declared style legible. Use the supplied name and, when present, the filtered positive traits; do not reuse subjects, actions, scenes, compositions, or stories from existing library entries. Generate one image, not a contact sheet.

## Import

After a representative image is available, run the deterministic importer from the repository root:

```powershell
python scripts/import_manual_style.py --source-name "中文风格名" --generation-name "English Generation Style Name" --traits "正向可见特征" --image "C:\absolute\path\representative.png"
```

- Omit `--traits` for name-only input.
- For traits-only input, pass the names you created with `--source-name` and `--generation-name`.
- Use `--dry-run` before importing when checking the selected activation policy would be useful.
- The importer assigns the next number, creates a 512px numbered tile and a 1024px 2×2 reference grid, continues the active H contact sheet, updates the source table and capability metadata, rebuilds the gallery, and runs full validation.

Manual styles use a number-only gallery badge. Do not add a fictitious author handle. Report the number, activation path, whether an image was generated or supplied, the active H sheet, and the validation result.
